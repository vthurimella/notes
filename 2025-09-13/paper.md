## Title: [A clever name for your system, e.g., "Gatekeeper: Taming the Data Deluge in AI-Steered Scientific Simulations"]
Abstract
A 4-5 sentence summary of the entire paper.

Problem: The integration of AI and HPC simulations introduces a critical trade-off between scientific throughput and system efficiency (data movement, energy).

Solution: We present [System Name], an intelligent gatekeeper that dynamically manages the interaction between the simulation and the AI agent.

Mechanism: [System Name] uses two policies, Temporal Batching and State-Aware Thresholding, to navigate this trade-off.

Result: Our evaluation shows that [System Name] can achieve up to X% of the AI's speedup while reducing the data movement cost by Y%, creating a new, superior Pareto frontier of performance-efficiency choices.

## 1. Introduction ðŸ“–
Your goal here is to hook the reader and convince them your problem is important and your solution is smart.

The Big Picture: Start broad. The convergence of AI and High-Performance Computing is revolutionizing science.

The Problem: This tight coupling, especially in "online" or "steering" workflows, creates massive data movement, threatening to overwhelm expensive supercomputer interconnects and budgets.

The Real Problem (Your Insight): This forces scientists into a terrible choice: run fast but be incredibly wasteful, or run efficiently but be slow. State the core trade-off between scientific throughput and system efficiency.

Your Solution as the Hero: Introduce [System Name] as the solution to this dilemma. State its high-level goal: to capture the benefits of AI steering without paying the full, crippling cost.

Bulleted Contributions: End with a clear, bulleted list of your contributions:

We identify and quantify the core trade-off between speed and efficiency in AI-steered workflows.

We design and implement [System Name], a lightweight gatekeeper system with two novel control policies.

We demonstrate through extensive evaluation on representative scientific applications that [System Name] establishes a new, superior performance-cost frontier.

Roadmap: "The rest of this paper is organized as follows..."

## 2. Background and Motivation
Here, you use a concrete example to make the problem undeniable.

What are AI-Steered Simulations?: Briefly explain the concept for non-experts. Use a diagram showing the feedback loop: Simulation -> AI -> Simulation.

Motivating Example: Introduce one of your representative applications (e.g., a molecular dynamics simulation).

Describe the "No AI" baseline (15 hours, low cost).

Describe the "Always AI" baseline (8 hours, crippling cost).

This is the perfect place for your 2D plot with only the two baseline points plotted.  It visually establishes the problem space and the two undesirable corners.

Problem Statement: Conclude by explicitly stating the problem your work solves, based on this example.

## 3. [System Name] Design
This is the high-level "what we do and why" section, using your advisor's "Goal â†’ Requirements â†’ Mechanisms" structure.

3.1. Design Goals: State the main objective: To minimize AI-related system costs (data, energy) while preserving the scientific benefits (speedup).

3.2. System Architecture: Provide a block diagram showing where your gatekeeper sits between the simulation and the AI model.

3.3. Core Mechanisms: Dedicate a subsection to each of your policies. Explain the logic and rationale behind them.

3.3.1. Temporal Batching: Explain how it amortizes the cost of AI interaction.

3.3.2. State-Aware Thresholding: Explain how it avoids redundant AI interventions when the simulation is stable.

## 4. Implementation
This section proves your system is real and gives just enough detail for someone else to replicate it.

Technology Stack: What languages, libraries, and frameworks did you use? (e.g., "Implemented in C++ with MPI for communication and integrated with a PyTorch-based AI agent.")

Integration: How does your gatekeeper intercept the data flow? Is it a proxy? A custom library?

State Monitoring: How do you practically measure the "state change" for your thresholding policy?

API: Briefly describe the API you expose to the scientist/user (e.g., how they set the batch size or threshold).

## 5. Evaluation
Here you describe the "how" of your experiments.

5.1. Experimental Platform: Detail the hardware (CPU, GPU, network interconnect) and software versions.

5.2. Representative Applications: Formally describe your workloads.

Application 1 (e.g., Molecular Dynamics): What does it simulate? Why is it a good case study?

Application 2 (e.g., Climate Modeling): How does it differ from the first? (This shows your approach is general).

5.3. Metrics: What are you measuring? (Time to solution in hours, total data moved in terabytes, energy in kWh).

## 6. Results ðŸ“Š
This is where you present your data and the Pareto frontier shines.

6.1. The Core Performance Trade-off: Present the full 2D Pareto frontier plot for your primary application. This is your "money shot" that proves the value of your work. Explain how to read the plot and what the frontier means.

6.2. Policy Analysis: Show how each mechanism contributes. You might have a plot showing the frontier generated by just batching vs. just thresholding.

6.3. Generalizability: Show the Pareto frontier plots for your other representative applications. This is crucial for proving your system isn't a one-trick pony.

6.4. System Overhead: Include a small section or table showing that your gatekeeper itself is lightweight and adds negligible CPU/memory overhead.
