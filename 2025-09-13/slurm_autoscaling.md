# Cluster Autoscaling and Allocation Measurement: Session Summary

## 1. Cluster Configuration Steps
- **Slurm & Munge Setup:** Ensured Slurm controller and daemons were running, fixed cgroup and Munge authentication issues.
- **NFS Shared Directory:** Set up `/users/vthurime/shared_parsl` as a dedicated NFS mount, exported from node0 and mounted on all nodes (node0-node3).
- **Python Environment:** Recreated the virtual environment in the shared directory to avoid broken interpreter paths after moving/copying.
- **Project Migration:** Moved `parsl_autoscale_test` and `parsl_env` into the shared NFS directory for consistent access across all nodes.
- **SlurmProvider Configuration:** Updated Parsl config to use `init_blocks=0`, `min_blocks=0`, `max_blocks=3` for true autoscaling from zero resources.

## 2. Experiment Code Overview
- **experiment.py:**
  - Submits multiple tasks to Parsl using the HighThroughputExecutor and SlurmProvider.
  - Records submission and completion times for each task.
  - Tracks which node each task runs on and prints clear autoscale events when a new node is first used.
  - Calculates and prints node acquisition latency (time from first task submission to first task execution on each node).

```python
# Key experiment.py logic
submission_times = []
completion_times = []
node_results = []
node_task_map = defaultdict(list)

for i in range(num_tasks):
    submit_time = time.time()
    app_future = slow_task(i, duration=duration)
    results.append(app_future)
    submission_times.append((i, submit_time))

for i, res in enumerate(results):
    result = res.result()
    end_time = time.time()
    node = result.split('on node ')[-1]
    completion_times.append((i, end_time))
    node_results.append((i, node, end_time))
    node_task_map[node].append(i)

first_seen = {}
first_submit = {}
for i, node, t in node_results:
    if node not in first_seen:
        first_seen[node] = t
        submit_time = submission_times[i][1]
        latency = t - submit_time
        print(f"=== AUTOSCALE EVENT: Node {node} first used at {t:.2f} ===")
        print(f"Node acquisition latency: {latency:.2f} seconds (submitted at {submit_time:.2f})\n")
```

- **batch_experiment.py:** Runs the experiment multiple times, saving each run's output for statistical analysis.
- **analyze_batch.py:** Parses all batch logs, extracts node acquisition latencies, and summarizes min, max, average, and per-event statistics.
- **plot_allocation.py & plot_coldstart_overlap.py:** Generate stepwise plots comparing serverless and node-based allocation times, including cold start scenarios.

## 3. Results & Insights
- **Node Acquisition Latency:** Measured ~24â€“29 seconds per node allocation, consistent across first, second, and third autoscale events.
- **Serverless vs Node-based:** Serverless allocation (2.5s/core) is much faster and more granular than node-based (27.87s/8 cores), as shown in the plots.
- **Batch Analysis:** Automated scripts provide robust statistics for inclusion in research papers.

## 4. Key Takeaways
- Accurate measurement of node allocation latency requires tracking both submission and execution times.
- Serverless autoscaling offers significant cold start and granularity advantages over traditional node-based cluster allocation.
- The provided code and workflow enable reproducible, quantitative comparison for publication.
