Summary of the Meeting
The central outcome of the meeting was a major strategic pivot on how to position Alicorn. Instead of presenting it as a competitor to existing workflow management systems (like Parsl or Mashup), you will now position it as a new enabling layer that extends existing systems with hybrid capabilities.

Ada's key insight was to move Alicorn from being "another workflow system" to a middleware layer that sits between high-level workflow managers and low-level infrastructure schedulers.

This reframing has several huge advantages:

It makes your contribution more novel and impactful. As Ada said, "It's always easy to say that they argue that you're doing something new versus you're doing something better." You are now adding a new capability to the ecosystem, not just incrementally improving an existing one.

It elegantly sidesteps direct, apples-to-apples comparisons. You no longer need to worry about perfectly fair comparisons with systems like Parsl because you are not replacing them; you are enhancing them. The comparison becomes "Workflow System X without Alicorn" vs. "Workflow System X with Alicorn."

It clarifies your system's architecture. Alicorn is the "sandwich" or the "glue" that allows high-level workflow systems (like Pegasus, Parsl) to intelligently use a mix of underlying resources (static clusters, auto-scaling SLURM, serverless functions) without needing to be rewritten for each one.

The core value proposition is that Alicorn provides the fine-grained elasticity of serverless computing combined with the near-native performance of dedicated clusters.
