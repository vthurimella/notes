Summary of Core Revisions 📝
The feedback from the reviews and your advisor converges on a clear path forward. The revisions fall into four main themes that address the critical weaknesses identified in your draft.

1. Repositioning the Narrative: From "Manager" to "Middleware"
This is the most critical change and the foundation for addressing most other critiques.

The Change: Shift ALICORN's identity from a new, standalone workflow management system to a middleware layer that sits between existing high-level frontends (like Parsl or Pegasus) and low-level infrastructure (like Kubernetes or SLURM). The core contribution is no longer inventing a new workflow system, but creating a component that 

enables existing systems to leverage hybrid resources effectively.





Why: This directly addresses the main criticism about a lack of novelty and poor positioning. It clarifies ALICORN's unique value proposition in a crowded field.



2. Deepening the Technical Details
Multiple reviewers found the Design and Implementation sections too brief and lacking the necessary detail for reproducibility and credibility.



The Change: Substantially expand the Design (§III) and Implementation (§IV) sections. Your advisor and Reviewer 1 suggest combining them into a single, detailed section.

Key Areas to Detail:


Scheduler Interaction: Explain precisely how the Conductor interacts with the native schedulers of the underlying platforms (e.g., creating Kubernetes Jobs, submitting sbatch scripts).


Data Management: Provide a deep dive into the decentralized, reference-based data layer. Detail the interaction between the task wrappers, the Redis tracker, and the node-local Nginx file servers. Explain how results from serverless tasks are stored and made accessible.




System Internals: Address fault tolerance (what if a node with data dies?), data lifecycle management (file cleanup), and the full task lifecycle from submission to completion. A lifecycle diagram was suggested to help clarify this.



Programming Model: Show a concrete "before and after" example of adapting an existing workflow (e.g., a Parsl script) to use ALICORN, proving the claim of "minimal annotations".

3. Overhauling the Evaluation
Nearly every reviewer agreed that the evaluation was the paper's weakest point, comparing ALICORN only against simple, non-state-of-the-art baselines.




The Change: Redesign the core experiment to be a "before and after" comparison that demonstrates ALICORN's value as a middleware layer.

New Experimental Design:


New Baseline: A state-of-the-art system running on a dynamic cluster (e.g., Parsl with its dynamic resource scaling on your Kubernetes/SLURM cluster).


ALICORN's Contribution: The same workflow running with "Parsl + ALICORN" on a hybrid environment, allowing it to burst to serverless resources.

Goal: Show that ALICORN achieves comparable (or better) makespan while dramatically improving resource utilization, thus proving its value-add.


Additional Metrics: As requested by reviewers, provide a performance breakdown of the makespan (time spent in scheduling, data transfer, execution, etc.) and measure the overhead of ALICORN's components (CPU, memory, IPC).


4. Updating Figures and Tables
Your visual aids need to be updated to reflect the new narrative and evaluation.

New Architecture Diagram: Create a new central figure that clearly depicts ALICORN as the middle layer between frontends and infrastructure.


Revised Related Work Table: Replace the existing Table I with a new, comprehensive table comparing ALICORN against Mashup, Parsl, Ray, Dask, and Task Vine, as suggested by Reviewer 1.

Updated Results Graphs: Re-generate your primary results graphs (like Figure 7) to reflect the new experimental comparison against a proper baseline.

Actionable Timeline 🗓️
Here is a phased plan to execute these revisions and meet the IPDPS deadlines.

Phase 1: Urgent Reframing & Abstract Submission (Now → Wed, Oct 1)
Goal: Solidify the new narrative and have a complete draft ready for the abstract deadline.

✅ Rewrite Abstract & Introduction: Implement the "middleware" narrative immediately.

✅ Create New Architecture Diagram: This is essential to visually explain the new positioning.

✅ Draft Revised Design/Implementation: Outline the expanded section and begin filling in the technical details on the Conductor and data layer.

✅ Create New Related Work Table: This helps solidify your contribution and positioning early.

✅ Draft the New Evaluation Section: Write the methodology for the new "Parsl vs. Parsl + ALICORN" experiment. You can use placeholder text for the results.

🚨 Deadline: Abstract Registration is Thursday, October 2nd.

Phase 2: Experimentation & Full Draft Integration (Thurs, Oct 2 → Mon, Oct 6)
Goal: Generate the key experimental data to support your new claims and integrate it into the paper.

🚀 Execute New Experiments: Run the "Parsl + ALICORN" comparison. This is the highest priority. Collect makespan, utilization, and overhead data.

📊 Analyze Results & Generate Figures: Process the new data and create the final versions of your results graphs and tables.

✍️ Flesh out Technical Details: Complete the expanded Design/Implementation section, ensuring all reviewer questions about fault tolerance, data lifecycle, etc., are answered.

📝 Integrate All Content: Perform a full pass of the paper to ensure the new narrative, design, and evaluation sections are consistent and flow logically.

Phase 3: Final Polish & Submission (Tues, Oct 7 → Wed, Oct 8)
Goal: Polish the final manuscript and submit.

🔍 Review & Refine: Read the entire paper from start to finish to catch any inconsistencies.

🤝 Peer Feedback: Have a colleague read the paper for a final check on clarity and impact.

✨ Final Polish: Check all figures, captions, references, and formatting. Address minor points like the double-anonymous violation ("our initial study") mentioned by Reviewer 2.

Submit! 🎉

🚨 Deadline: Full Paper Submission is Thursday, October 9th.
